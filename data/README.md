# Data

This project uses the **Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data** dataset, publicly available on Kaggle.

## Raw Data
Raw datasets are not included in this repository due to size and licensing considerations.
The original data can be accessed directly from the source on Kaggle.

## Clean Data
The `clean/` directory contains cleaned and aggregated datasets used directly in the analysis scripts.
These files were produced through reproducible R workflows and represent the final analytical inputs.

All data in this repository is used strictly for educational and portfolio purposes.
