# Executive Summary

## Objective

The objective of this analysis was to uncover non-intuitive patterns in how women use smart health devices, using Fitbit data as a proxy, to inform Bellabeat’s product development—particularly the Leaf tracker and Bellabeat app—and support its marketing strategy.

Multiple datasets related to physical activity, sleep behavior, heart rate, and calorie expenditure were analyzed to identify meaningful trends in real-world user behavior.

## Key Insights

-   **Higher levels of daily physical activity were associated with lower average body weight**, although the relationship was not strictly linear.
-   **Users with lower activity levels consistently recorded longer sleep durations** than more active users, suggesting that sleep quantity alone may not reflect overall wellness.
-   **Average heart rate increased steadily with higher activity intensity levels**, validating the physiological consistency of the activity classifications.
-   **Energy expenditure rose significantly with activity intensity**, with noticeable differences between weekdays and weekends.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Strategic Recommendations

Based on these findings, Bellabeat can take several data-driven actions to improve both product experience and user engagement:

-   Develop personalized in-app insights that emphasize **activity quality and intensity**, rather than step count alone.
-   Design sleep-related features that focus on **sleep efficiency and recovery**, not just total sleep duration.
-   Leverage heart rate and calorie expenditure data to deliver **adaptive feedback and wellness recommendations**.
-   Launch targeted marketing campaigns aligned with **real user behavior patterns**, differentiating weekday and weekend activity habits.

## Business Impact

By aligning product features and marketing initiatives with observed user behavior, Bellabeat can strengthen user engagement and reinforce its positioning as a **data-informed, women-centered wellness brand**.
