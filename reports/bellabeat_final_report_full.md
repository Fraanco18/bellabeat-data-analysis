# Executive Summary

The objective of this analysis was to uncover non-intuitive patterns in how women use smart health devices, using Fitbit data as a proxy, to inform Bellabeat’s product development—particularly the Leaf tracker and Bellabeat app—and support its marketing strategy. Multiple datasets related to physical activity, sleep behavior, heart rate, and calorie expenditure were analyzed to identify meaningful trends in real-world user behavior.

The analysis revealed several key insights:

-   Higher levels of daily physical activity were associated with lower average body weight, although this relationship was not strictly linear.
-   Users with lower activity levels consistently recorded longer sleep durations than more active users, suggesting that sleep quantity alone may not reflect overall wellness.
-   Average heart rate increased steadily with higher activity intensity levels, validating the physiological consistency of the activity classifications.
-   Energy expenditure rose significantly with activity intensity, with noticeable differences between weekdays and weekends.

Based on these findings, Bellabeat can take several data-driven actions to improve both product experience and user engagement:

-   Develop personalized in-app insights that emphasize activity quality and intensity rather than step count alone.
-   Design sleep-related features that focus on sleep efficiency and recovery, not just total sleep duration.
-   Leverage heart rate and calorie expenditure data to deliver adaptive feedback and wellness recommendations.
-   Launch targeted marketing campaigns aligned with real user behavior patterns, differentiating weekday and weekend activity habits.

By aligning product features and marketing initiatives with observed user behavior, Bellabeat can strengthen user engagement and reinforce its positioning as a data-informed wellness brand.

# Data Sources & Data Cleaning (Methodology)

This section describes the data sources used, their main limitations, and the methodological process applied for data cleaning and preparation prior to exploratory analysis and visualization.

## Data Sources

For this analysis, the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data dataset was used. This dataset is publicly available on the Kaggle platform and was collected by Mobius. It contains anonymized data generated by Fitbit devices, including metrics related to daily physical activity, sleep, body weight, and heart rate.

The dataset covers a period between April and May 2016 and consists of records from 30 users who voluntarily agreed to share their data. The information is provided across multiple CSV files, each corresponding to a specific type of metric.

Although the data does not come directly from Bellabeat users, it is considered an appropriate proxy for this analysis, as Bellabeat operates within the same health and wellness tracking market segment. This allows for the exploration of behavioral patterns that can support the development of data-driven strategic recommendations.

## Data Reliability & Limitations

While the dataset is useful for identifying general behavioral patterns, several limitations must be considered when interpreting the results:

-   The sample size is small (30 users), which limits the generalizability of the findings.
-   The data comes from users who voluntarily shared their information, introducing a potential self-selection bias.
-   The dataset lacks detailed demographic information such as age, gender, or socioeconomic context. Given that Bellabeat primarily targets women, it is not possible to confirm whether the observed patterns accurately represent its core audience.
-   The data was collected in 2016, and therefore may not fully reflect current user habits or technology usage trends.
-   It is assumed that users wore their Fitbit devices correctly and consistently, although individual adherence and measurement accuracy cannot be independently verified.

These limitations were taken into account throughout the analysis to ensure a responsible and realistic interpretation of the results.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Data Cleaning Process

The data cleaning and preparation process was conducted using the R programming language, with the objective of ensuring data quality, consistency, and reliability prior to exploratory analysis and visualization.

## Datasets Used

The original dataset consisted of 7 CSV files, with the following characteristics:

-   daily_activity_merged.csv: 940 observations and 15 variables, including daily activity metrics such as steps, calories burned, distance, and active minutes.
-   daily_calories_merged.csv: 940 observations and 3 variables containing daily calorie data.
-   daily_steps_merged.csv:940 observations and 3 variables recording total daily steps.
-   daily_intensities_merged.csv: 940 observations and 10 variables detailing daily activity intensity levels.
-   sleepDay_merged.csv: 413 observations and 5 variables related to sleep duration and quality.
-   weightLogInfo_merged.csv: 67 observations and 8 variables related to body weight and composition.
-   heartrate_seconds_merged.csv: 2,483,658 observations and 3 variables capturing heart rate measurements at the second level.

For the core analysis, 6 of these datasets were actively used, excluding daily_intensities_merged.csv. Activity intensity information was instead derived from the aggregated variables already available in daily_activity_merged.csv. This decision simplified the data model without compromising analytical relevance.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation Steps

Prior to analysis, the following steps were performed:

-   Identification and removal of duplicate records, missing values, and incomplete entries
-   Exclusion of users with insufficient data coverage
-   Standardization of date and time formats across all datasets
-   Transformation of temporal variables to identify day of the week and day type (weekday vs. weekend)
-   Integration of multiple datasets using user identifiers and shared dates
-   Validation of internal consistency across key metrics such as steps, calories, active minutes, and sleep duration
-   Creation of derived variables to support downstream analysis and insight generation

This cleaning process ensured that the final dataset was coherent, comparable, and suitable for addressing the defined business questions.

## Tools Used

The analysis and data preparation were conducted using tools designed to support reproducible analysis and effective data visualization:

-   **R** as the primary programming language
-   **RStudio** as the development environment
-   **tidyverse** for data manipulation and transformation
-   **dplyr** for filtering, grouping, and summarization
-   **lubridate** for date handling and standardization
-   **ggplot2** for exploratory and final data visualizations

This toolset enabled a structured, efficient, and reproducible analytical workflow.

## Methodological Assumptions

The following methodological assumptions were established during the analysis:

-   Users were assumed to wear their Fitbit devices correctly and consistently throughout the data collection period.
-   Available daily records were considered representative of users’ general habits, despite potential individual variability or atypical days.
-   The results are interpreted as exploratory and indicative, rather than definitive or broadly generalizable.
-   The integration of multiple data sources was assumed to provide a coherent representation of user behavior, even though some metrics were not uniformly available for all users.

## Conclusion

This section provides a clear, transparent, and professional description of the data sources, limitations, and technical decisions underpinning the analysis, establishing a solid foundation for the insights and recommendations presented in subsequent sections.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Insight 1: Physical Activity, Body Weight, and Heart Rate Patterns

## Key Finding

The analysis shows a relationship between users’ daily step counts and body weight, where users with higher average daily steps tend to present lower body weight values.

![](figures/Q1_daily_activity%20vs%20body_weight.png)

Additionally, the physiological data shows **slight variation in average heart rate across activity levels**, with users in the ‘Moderate’ and ‘High’ activity categories exhibiting marginally lower average heart rates compared to the ‘Low’ activity group.

![](figures/Q5_average_heart_rate_by_physical_activity_level.png)

Together, these results suggest that the step-based activity classifications are reflected not only in body-related metrics but also in physiological responses, supporting the internal consistency of the activity data.

![](figures/Q5_relationship_between_daily_steps_and_average_heart_rate.png)

## Why this matters for Bellabeat

This insight highlights the value of step-based activity tracking as a meaningful indicator of both physical movement and physiological engagement. It supports the use of daily steps as a core metric for user feedback, progress tracking, and personalized wellness guidance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Insight 2: Activity Patterns and Energy Expenditure Across the Week

## Key Finding

Physical activity patterns remain highly consistent across weekdays and weekends, with only a marginal difference of approximately 1% in average daily steps. Users average slightly more steps on weekends than on weekdays, reinforcing the overall stability of movement behavior throughout the week.

![](figures/Q2_weekday_vs_weekend_steps.png)

In contrast, energy expenditure increases substantially with higher activity intensity. Users classified in higher activity levels burn approximately 26% more calories than those in the “Low” activity group.

![](figures/Q6_average_daily_calories_burned_by_physica_activity_level.png)

Additionally, calorie burn remains comparable between weekdays and weekends when activity intensity is similar, indicating that energy expenditure is primarily driven by activity level rather than by the type of day.

![](figures/Q6_average_daily_calories_burned_weekdays_vs_weekends.png)

## Why this matters for Bellabeat

This insight highlights that promoting higher activity intensity is more impactful than focusing on specific days of the week. Bellabeat can leverage this finding to encourage consistent movement habits while emphasizing that meaningful energy expenditure can be achieved on both weekdays and weekends through increased activity intensity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Insight 3: Physical Activity and Sleep Duration & Onset Patterns

## Key Finding

Daily step counts show weak and inconsistent associations with both total sleep duration and the time it takes users to fall asleep. While a slight negative relationship with sleep duration is observed in some scenarios (**r = -0.22**)

![](figures/Q3_daily_steps_vs_sleep_duration.png)

this association diminishes substantially when data quality improves (**r = -0.08**), suggesting limited explanatory power.

![](figures/Q3_daily_steps_vs_sleep_duration_≥5_sleep_records.png)

Similarly, the relationship between physical activity and sleep onset time is weak. Notably, the “High Activity” group showed longer average sleep onset times, a pattern **influenced by variability and outlier**s.

![](figures/Q4_average_sleep_onset_time_by_activity_level.png)

Overall, these findings indicate that daily physical activity alone is not a strong predictor of sleep outcomes within this dataset.

![](figures/Q4_relationship_between%20_physical_activity_and_sleep_onset_time.png)

## Why this matters for Bellabeat

This insight suggests that sleep outcomes are influenced by multiple factors beyond daily physical activity alone. Relying solely on step counts to provide sleep coaching could lead to inaccurate user expectations. For Bellabeat, this highlights the importance of delivering holistic sleep insights that integrate activity, routines, and recovery behaviors, rather than relying exclusively on step-based metrics to explain sleep patterns.
