# Q1 – Physical Activity vs. Body Weight

## Analytical Approach
The analysis was conducted at the user level to avoid bias caused by uneven daily recording frequency.

Average daily step counts and body weight were aggregated per user and merged using inner joins to ensure that only users with complete records were included.

## Key Decisions
- User-level aggregation was chosen over daily-level analysis to improve comparability.
- Inner joins were used to maintain analytical consistency across datasets.
- Average daily step count was used as a proxy for overall activity level.

## Limitations
- Small effective sample size after filtering users with complete records.
- Observational data prevents causal interpretation.
- Body weight measurements were not recorded uniformly across users.
